Gaussian processes provide a convenient framework to address many regression and classification problems.

1. In `MPGPredictionViaGaussianProcessRegressor.py` I used the `Gaussian Process Regressor` model (consult https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor.html#sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor) to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of vehicles based on a few predictor variables.

2. In `WineClassificationViaGaussianProcessClassifier.py` I used the `Gaussian Process Classifier` model (consult https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessClassifier.html#sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessClassifier) to perform wine classification based on a few predictor variables.
