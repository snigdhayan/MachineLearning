# MachineLearning

In `CreditCardFraudDetection.py` I used the `Local Outlier Factor (LOF)` model (consult https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor.html#sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor) to predict credit card fraud based on the kaggle dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv. Using this approach I was able to achieve an accuracy above 90%.
