# MachineLearning

I analyzed the breast cancer dataset (`30 features` and `569 entries`) using some standard machine learning algorithms like

1. `Logistic regression`, 
2. `Support vector machine` and 
3. `Decision tree`

I also compared their prediction accuracies with those of some semi-supervised learning approaches (consult `BreastCancerAnalysisViaML.py`).
